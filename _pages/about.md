Hi there, I'm Victor. I am a Senior Research Fellow at <a href='https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/psychology'>Cardiff University</a> using experimental methods and mathematical formalism to study the learning processes in human and non-human animals. What about you?

Feel free to explore around. Hope you enjoy your stay!

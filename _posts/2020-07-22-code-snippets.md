An easy way to make tinkerable code is to use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). I will start posting some code snippets I find useful in my blog entries. More often than not, I only get true understanding from coding. Perhaps wrongly, I assume other people are the same. Here's an example that I wrote for an undergrad student I'm currently working with. It involves calculating SDT measures for categorization data.

You can interact with the code by clicking this badge.  <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/victor-navarro/binder-repo/master?filepath=sdt_categorization.ipynb" target="blank">![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)</a>

A static view of the code is shown below.

You only see the tip of it

Here's a Jupyter notebook that illustrates the modelling I did for a recent paper on [the attentional profiles of pigeons and humans](/pubs/human-pigeon-attention/). Some numerical optimization is done in it, so be patient if you try the live version. You can access live code by clicking this badge <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/victor-navarro/binder-repo/master?filepath=Recovering%20attention%20from%20GCM.ipynb" target="blank">![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)</a>

Otherwise, a static view of the code is shown below.

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/iceberg.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/iceberg.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}

In what follows, I train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate fake images of breast cancer tissue. GANs are pretty cool, and so I wanted to dip my toes on them.

This one follows a basic GAN [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) to the point. All credit goes to them.

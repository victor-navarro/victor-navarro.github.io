I am developing an R package that includes some cool associative learning models. You can find it in its [github repository](https://github.com/victor-navarro/calm).

Better yet, you can access its own webpage with documentation and examples at [https://victornavarro.org/calm/](https://victornavarro.org/calm/)

Even betterer, you can access a [Shiny app](https://victor-navarro.shinyapps.io/calm_app/) that allows to do simulations using a fairly simple syntax.

I used [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) for the first time over the last research away day @ Cardiff. Within the same week, I used it again to gauge the overall knowledge level of my audience during a web seminar.

I presented some of the work I've done with Rob and Dom during the seminar; the work tends to have a ton of math, but I was lucky the audience were a bunch of nerds in our field.

The talk went well, although I forgot to ask how much more confused people were after my talk.

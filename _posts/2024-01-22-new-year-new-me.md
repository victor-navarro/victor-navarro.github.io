It's been a while since I've updated my personal webpage, and whilst reinstalling Jekyll, I though I'd try a new template. Like with most things in life, less is more, so here's my attempt at being even more minimalistic.

In trying to migrate to this system, I'll likely lose some of the old posts. I guess that's a lesson to use more robust tools in the future.

I'll have to dig up some very old jupyter notebooks...

I will always be interested in associative learning. It is what I've done the most, for the longest.

The bulk of this work involves formal analysis and development of associative learning models, and model validation via empirical studies. For a recent output of these efforts, head to the publications page or the calm tab above.

I am currently working in assessing a novel model of dopaminergic function that proposed a very clever learning mechanism.

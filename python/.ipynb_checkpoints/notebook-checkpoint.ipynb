In the plot, this fact is illustrated by the solid and dashed black lines. The solid line connects the expected RTs on correct and incorrect trials, for high prevalence trials. On high prevalence trials, the probability of being correct is larger than the probability of being incorrect, of course, and so, the weighted average of RTs should approximate the expected RT for correct trials (black dot). Coversely, the dashed line connects the expected correct and incorrect RTs on low prevalence trials.
